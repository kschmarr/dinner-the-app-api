# Dinner. The app.

This is a project used for keeping track of where you are in your dinner rotation. If you're like me, you can't remember more than a few meals back and you can't recall every meal you cook or restaurant that you like. This app does all of that for you. Never get sucked into the habit of just cooking the same few meals again and again. This app keeps you rotating through a variety of meals based on a fine tuned algorithm.

# How to begin:

Continue reading this README file.
Sign up at the site: https://dinner-the-app.now.sh/
Add all of your homecooked meals, chef cooked meals, or restaurants to the database.
Click the 'See Current Meal' link in the navigation bar to view which meal is up now in your rotation.
Once you have eaten this meal click the 'Next Meal' button.
Continue eating yummy food.
If you ever want to edit the name or frequency of a meal (or delete it entirely) just click the 'Edit Meal' button on the home page or access the 'Edit Meal' page from the 'See All Meals' page (link in the nav bar) by clicking on the name of a meal.
You can also add meals at any time by clicking the 'Add Meal' link in the nav bar. These will automatically get shuffled in to your rotation.
Bon appetit, καλή όρεξη, Guten Appetit, En guete!
